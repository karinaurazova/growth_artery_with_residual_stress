# growth_artery_with_residual_stress
This repository implements a computational model for analyzing residual stresses in growing cylindrical vessels (e.g. arteries) using morphoelasticity theory, a Python script solves nonlinear mechanics equations and visualizes stress distributions under different growth scenarios.
